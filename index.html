            <h4>Exploring the Robustness of Gait Cycle and Gait Phase Recognition Using IMU Sensors</h4>
            <ul id="project-description">
                <li>IMU sensor reliability was evaluated in terms of assessing human gait cycles and phases. Developed algorithms and
                    analyzed data to assess the accuracy and robustness of IMU-based gait recognition systems, processing 73,000 data
                    points.</li>
                <li>The evaluation of Gait-Phase recognition systems yielded a 98% accuracy rate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Tamil Text Summarization from YouTube Videos: An Automated Insight Generation Approach
            </h4>
            <ul id="">
                <li>Translated 1500 English YouTube comments into Tamil and performed preprocessing activities such as tokenization
                    and sentence segmentation.</li>
                <li>Implemented TextRank algorithm for extractive summarization and Used a Sentence Transformer model to compute
                    similarity scores. Enhanced summarization efficiency by 12%.</li>    
            </ul>
            <h4>Semi-Supervised Sentiment Mining in the YouTube Universe: Leveraging Partially Labeled Data to Unveil
                Positive, Negative, and Neutral Clusters using K-Means</h4>
            <ul id="project-description">
                <li>Semi-supervised sentiment mining was used to analyze 50,000 YouTube comments. In sentiment classification, we
                    achieved an accuracy of 85%.</li>
                <li>Using K-Means clustering as K value is 3, we identified positive, negative, and neutral sentiment clusters.</li>
                <li>Uncovered insights include 60% good, 25% negative, and 15% neutral comments. Finally, Improved data-driven decision making for content strategy</li>
